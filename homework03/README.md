# Implementing ANNs with TensorFlow - Homework 02

## Assignment: CIFAR-10 classification

In this homework, we train a convolutional neural network to classify objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We build the CNN from scratch and test the influence of architecture, learning rate, and the optimizer on the results of the model.
